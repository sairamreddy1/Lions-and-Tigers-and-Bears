# Dogs — JavaScript & An API
Fetch, Promises & Async/Await Slideshow App

This project is based on Brad Schiff’s excellent tutorial **“Dogs, JavaScript & An API Fetch, Promises & Async Await.”**  
It displays dog images from the public Dog CEO API and cycles through them in a slideshow.  
The application is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, Fetch**, and deployed as an **Azure Static Web App**.
